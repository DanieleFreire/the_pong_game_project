OOP using turtle library to randomly move the ball to diferent positions and directions, as well as to increase the ball speed when scored, which happens when the ball collides on the paddles, and then bounces back to the screen.

When the ball hits the wall the opposite player scores.

Use "Up" and "Down" key to move the right paddle and "w" and "s" to move the left paddle.
